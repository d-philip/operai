The period is around 1670.

Act 1 - The Departure from Chamounix

Early morning in the mountain village of Chamounix. * 

Preparations are underway to send many of the young people to Paris, * where they must go because there is no work at home during the winter.* 

He worries about his family's future: * the lease of their farm is expiring and he has been unable to renew it. * 

He receives good news from the administrator, * however: the nobleman will plead his case with his sister, the land owner. *

The nobleman comes to his home. * He says he wants to assure him of his protection, but he is really interested in the young and beautiful woman. * 

When he asks to make her acquaintance he is told that she has already gone to church. (In fact, she worked late the night before, and is still asleep.) * 

However he promises his help with the lease renewal * and offers to accomodate her at the castle and to take charge of her education.*

She is in a hurry because she is late for her daily rendezvous with a young artist from Paris who is working in the village. * 

On the way she meets a young orphan who is leaving for Paris with the other young people to earn money so that he may continue to make music in the summer. * 

He is asked to sing his newest song, a ballad about a girl who goes away to work and has an unhappy love affair: when she returns home, her mother is dead *

She is troubled by the song. * She meets the man who has been waiting for her * 

He expresses his wish to remain in the village with her: it is impossible for now, and he cannot divulge the reason (he is the son of the nobleman). * Both hope that everything will work out. *

The religious leader takes him aside and informs him of the nobleman's real intentions. * 

He proposes to let her go to Paris, in order to put her beyond the nobleman's reach: his brother lives there and could put her up. * Both express their trust in providence. *

She comes with a letter from the nobleman, and announces that she will be a guest at the castle. * 

The religious leader informs her that she must leave the village instead. *

The group is assembled to greet those who are leaving. * The religious leader invokes heaven's protection of them, and everyone prays. *

Act 2 - Paris

He has followed her to Paris: he had revealed his identity to her and offered to provide for her until the day of their marriage. * She accepted and is now living in a luxurious home. * She is worried because she has had no news from home for three months. * Hearing music of Savoy played on a hurdy-gurdy outside, she recognizes the man and invites him in.*

She informs the man of her engagement to him. *He tells her that after having been ill he searched for her at the religious leader's brother's house, but that he was no longer living there (which is why she had received no news from her family).* He asks her if the nobleman knows of her engagement: she says that all is still secret and she does not know when they will be married. *He congratulates her and leaves.*

The nobleman appears: he has seen her in Paris and has found her home.* He assumes she is the lover of some rich man, so he offers her a finer house and more money. *She is insulted and orders him to leave.*

The man now comes in: he is desperate because his mother the nobleman has discovered his engagement with the woman. * She will not allow him to marry a peasant's daughter and has arranged a suitable wedding; she threatens to have the woman imprisoned if he refuses.* He even thinks of suicide.* When the woman comes in, he does not have the heart to tell her the truth.*

She is worrying about the man's behaviour when her father appears at the door. *He desperately needs help, having been unable to renew his leasehold, and is looking for the Viscount.* He does not recognize the woman, and she feels that in her ambiguous situation it is better not to reveal her identity. *She gives him some money, but when he tearfully tells her about the daughter he has lost she is moved and reveals her identity to him. * The man is shocked, and refuses to recognize the mistress of an aristocrat in his honest daughter.* The woman asks him for forgiveness, but he answers that he has nothing to forgive- he does not even know her.*

The man hurries in because he has heard of the couple's wedding. *That is too much for him: he begins to curse the woman, but the man restrains him and he departs in a rage.*

The woman goes mad, and the man takes her away from the house.*
Act 3 - The Return to Chamounix

A spring day in Chamounix.* The young french people are returning home with the money they earned in Paris, and the group celebrates the event. *Only the man and the woman are missing.*

The religious leader is thinking about the man's misfortune (his daughter is the only young person who did not return to the village) when the Viscount approaches him.* He has found the courage to refuse the arranged marriage and his mother has finally consented to his marriage with the woman.* He has come to fulfil his promises: to marry the woman and to restore the honor of her family.* The religious leader informs him that the woman is dead for her family and for the village. *The man swears to be faithful to her forever.*

The nobleman arrives. *He announces a great celebration for the wedding of his nephew with a beautiful lady of the country, but he does not reveal the bride's identity *

The man and the woman appear from the hillside: the woman, still mad, is nearly unconscious: only the musician's music keeps her going. * The religious leader is the first to encounter them, and immediately goes to tell the woman's parents. *On his way he meets the man, who has brought the mortgage for the farm and is about to leave for Paris to search for the woman.* The nobleman arrives with all the townsfolk.* The man and the mother are desperate because the woman does not recognize them.*

The man suggests to the man that the woman might recognize him when he plays his music, as that is the only thing she reacts to.* The man speaks to her, but the woman says that the real person would have spoken other words to her. * He understands, and sings the refrain from their first act duet.* The woman joins in and recognizes him, then the others: she is healed!* Everyone celebrates.
