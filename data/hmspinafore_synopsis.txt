The Pinafore, a saucy beauty of a ship in Her Majesty's navy is anchored in the harbour at Portsmouth.* Its proud sailors are busy scrubbing the decks for the expected arrival of Sir Joseph Porter, K.C.B., Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty.* Little Buttercup, a bumboat woman who is "red and round and rosy"* comes aboard to sell to the sailors her stock of "snuff and tobaccy and excellent jacky," and other luxuries.*

A handsome and accomplished sailor, Ralph, tells his messmates that he is in love with the Captain's daughter, Josephine.* Dick Deadeye, the embodiment of the ugly truth, reminds the starry-eyed seaman that Captain's daughters don't marry foremast hands!* The Captain arrives to inspect his crew.* The gentleman captain sings that he never uses foul language and is never sick at sea — well, "hardly ever."*

Josephine is sought in marriage by Sir Joseph, but it seems that she has no enthusiasm for a union with that cabinet minister —* secretly, she is in love with a lowly sailor: Ralph.* It also seems that Little Buttercup has a romantic interest in the Captain and harbours a secret about Ralph!*

Finally, Sir Joseph arrives attended by his many "sisters and his cousins and his aunts," among whom is his loyal but jealous cousin Hebe.* He explains that he rose to the top post in the Navy by sticking close to his desk and never going to sea.* He also encourages the Captain to request that his sailors follow an order with the phrase "if you please."* After all, his Lordship notes, "a British sailor is any man's equal."* Indeed, he presents the crew with a song that he himself has composed to encourage "independence of thought and action in the lower branches" of the Navy.* Sir Joseph and the Captain retire below decks to discuss the proposed marriage.*

Ralph finds Josephine alone on deck and declares his love for her and his willingness to try to fit in with middle-class society.* She rejects his proffered love, although his simple eloquence goes to her heart.* She is a dutiful daughter and cannot forget the disparity in their ranks.* But when Ralph threatens suicide, the lady relents and declares her love for him.* With the crew and the sisters, cousins and aunts assisting, the lovers plot to elope that very night.* Dick Deadeye warns the pair of the impropriety of their plan, but he is forced to retreat.*

Act 2
Captain Corcoran is alone on deck with his guitar and sings to the moon of his troubles.* Little Buttercup comes to him and reveals her affection.* He tells her that because of his rank he can never be more to her than a friend;* but she hints darkly that a change is in store for him, and "things are seldom what they seem."*

Sir Joseph returns, complaining that Josephine does not favour his suit.* The Captain comforts him by theorizing that she is dazzled by his lofty station and suggests that he plead his cause on the ground that "love levels all ranks".* When Josephine hears this argument, she considers how eloquently Sir Joseph has stated the justification for her to marry Ralph!*

Dick Deadeye finds the Captain alone and reveals the planned elopement.* He and the Captain lie in wait for the crew, who steal in "carefully on tip-toe."* The Captain confronts the elopers and is so exasperated that he actually swears a foul oath, "Damme!", which is overheard by Sir Joseph Porter.* Judging first and asking questions later, Sir Joseph orders the Captain to go to his cabin for this "ill-advised asperity."*

Upon inquiry, Sir Joseph finds out that Ralph and Josephine love one another and orders the "presumptuous" sailor to the brig.* Affairs are interrupted by Little Buttercup, who discloses her long-concealed secret:* As their foster mother, she had exchanged the Captain and Ralph while they were both babies.*

Sir Joseph immediately sends for Ralph (who is now Captain) and the Captain (who is now a humble seaman).* Since it is "out of the question" for Sir Joseph to marry the daughter of a mere sailor, his Lordship nobly consents to the marriage of Ralph and Josephine.* The former Captain is now free to marry dear Little Buttercup, and Sir Joseph agrees to marry his longtime admirer, cousin Hebe.* All ends with "joy and rapture unforseen," for "he is an Englishman!"* Hip, Hip, Horray!*
